# AI Art Gallery ProjectThis project presents a responsive web application showcasing AI-generated artworks. It's designed to be easily deployable as a GitHub Pages site, demonstrating a clean, modern UI with Tailwind CSS and a simple client-side single-page application (SPA) experience within `index.html`.## Project StructureWhile the core application functionality is self-contained within `index.html` for simplicity in this deliverable, a full GitHub Pages deployment would typically include the following files for better organization and content management (as outlined in the initial request):- `index.html`: The main homepage, containing the entire web application logic (home, gallery, about sections) and serving as the entry point.- `gallery.html` (Hypothetical): A dedicated page for the gallery. **(Content now integrated into `index.html`)**- `about.md` (Hypothetical): A markdown file for the about section. **(Content now integrated into `index.html`)**- `metadata.json` (Hypothetical): Stores details about the artworks. **(Content now integrated into `index.html`'s JavaScript)**- `style.css` (Hypothetical): Custom styles. **(Tailwind CSS is used, and any additional styling is inline)**- `script.js` (Hypothetical): JavaScript for interactive elements. **(Integrated into `index.html`)**- `LICENSE`: Contains the MIT License details.- `uid.txt`: An additional file provided in the project root, used as-is. Its specific purpose is not defined within the scope of this web application's functionality.## Features- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.- **AI Art Gallery**: Showcases 5 distinct AI-generated artworks with titles, descriptions, creators, and AI models.- **Interactive Lightbox**: Click on any artwork to view a larger image and its details in a modal.- **Single-Page Application (SPA) Feel**: Navigation between Home, Gallery, and About sections happens dynamically without full page reloads, all within `index.html`.- **Clean UI**: Modern and minimalist interface powered by Tailwind CSS.## Technologies Used- **HTML5**: For the structure of the web page.- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and responsive design.- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: For dynamic content loading, lightbox functionality, and SPA-like navigation.## How to Run Locally1.  **Save the file**: Save the provided `index.html` content into a file named `index.html` in a directory.2.  **Open in Browser**: Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. All content and functionality are self-contained.## Deployment to GitHub Pages1.  **Create a GitHub Repository**: Initialize a new public repository on GitHub.2.  **Upload Files**: Upload `index.html`, `README.md`, and `LICENSE` to the root of your repository. If you have the `uid.txt` file, upload that as well.3.  **Enable GitHub Pages**: Go to your repository's settings, navigate to the "Pages" section, and configure GitHub Pages to deploy from the `main` (or `master`) branch.4.  **Access Your Site**: After a few moments, your site will be live at `https://<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io/<YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME>/`.## Project Roadmap (Future Enhancements)- Implement actual API calls for artwork data instead of static data.- Add filtering and sorting options for the gallery.- Integrate a comment or feedback system for artworks.- Enhance the lightbox with navigation for multiple images.- Implement client-side routing with proper URL paths for shareable links to specific sections.
